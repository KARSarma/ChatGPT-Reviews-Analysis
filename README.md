## Objectives
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classify reviews into positive, neutral, and negative categories.
- **Text Analysis:** Uncover key themes and identify common issues.
- **Trend Analysis:** Track sentiment changes over time.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide recommendations to enhance user experience.

## Key Features
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Use NLP techniques to categorize reviews.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Clean and tokenize textual data for accurate analysis.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Identify frequently mentioned words and phrases.
- **Visualization:** Display sentiment trends and distributions with clear visual representations.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries and Tools:**
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy` for data manipulation.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `TextBlob` or `spaCy` for sentiment analysis.
  - `WordCloud` for keyword visualization.
  - `Jupyter Notebook` for interactive data exploration.

## Dataset Information
The dataset includes:
- User reviews of ChatGPT.
- Ratings on a scale of 1–5 stars.
- Review timestamps for temporal analysis.

**Dataset Challenges:**
- Imbalanced sentiment distribution.
- Missing values in review text.
- Noisy textual data requiring preprocessing.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KARSarma/ChatGPT-Reviews-Analysis.git
   cd ChatGPT-Reviews-Analysis
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment:**
   - Install Python 3.7 or higher.
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Open `ChatGPT_Reviews_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, analyze reviews, and generate insights.

## Sample Analysis

### Sentiment Analysis
```python
from textblob import TextBlob

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
        return 'Positive'
    elif analysis.sentiment.polarity == 0:
        return 'Neutral'
    else:
        return 'Negative'

data['Sentiment'] = data['Review'].apply(analyze_sentiment)
```

### Visualization
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.countplot(x='Sentiment', data=data)
plt.title('Sentiment Distribution')
plt.show()
```

### Results and Insights
- **Sentiment Analysis:** 70% positive, 20% neutral, and 10% negative reviews.
- **Trends Over Time:** Positive sentiment increased by 15% over six months.
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Average score of 40, indicating moderate user loyalty.
- **Common Issues:** Users frequently cited reliability, accuracy, and app performance as areas for improvement.

## Visualizations
- **Sentiment Distribution:** Bar chart displaying proportions of positive, neutral, and negative reviews.
- **Word Cloud:** Visualization of most frequently used terms.
- **Trends Over Time:** Line chart illustrating sentiment evolution.
